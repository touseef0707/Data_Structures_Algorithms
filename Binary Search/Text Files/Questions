QUESTION 1:
Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the cards in
decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table. She
challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning
over as few cards as possible. Write a function to help Bob locate the card.

QUESTION 2:
Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the
starting and ending position of a given number.

QUESTION 3:
--ROTATED LISTS--
You are given list of numbers, obtained by rotating a sorted list an unknown
number of times. Write a function to determine the minimum number of times the
original sorted list was rotated to obtain the given list. Your function
should have the worst-case complexity of O(log N), where N is the length of
the list. You can assume that all the numbers in the list are unique.

Example: The list [5, 6, 9, 0, 2, 3, 4] was obtained by rotating the sorted
list [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9] 3 times.

We define "rotating a list" as removing the last element of the list and
adding it before the first element. E.g. rotating the list [3, 2, 4, 1]
produces [1, 3, 2, 4].

"Sorted list" refers to a list where the elements are arranged in the increasing
order e.g. [1, 3, 5, 7].
