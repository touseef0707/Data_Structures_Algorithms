## Summary and Exercises

We've covered the following sorting algorithms in this tutorial:

1. Bubble sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Merge sort
4. Quick sort

There are several other sorting algorithms, and most languages provide
library functions for sorting that use a hybrid approach depending on the
size and type of element in the list/array.
