## Problem
In this notebook, we'll focus on solving the following problem:

> **QUESTION 1**:
You're working on a new feature on Jovian called "Top Notebooks of the Week".
Write a function to sort a list of notebooks in decreasing order of likes. Keep in
mind that up to millions of notebooks  can be created every week, so your function
needs to be as efficient as possible.

The problem of sorting a list of objects comes up over and over in computer science
and software development, and it's important to understand common approaches for
sorting, and the trade-offs they offer. Before we solve the above problem, we'll
solve a simplified version of the problem:

> **QUESTION 2**:
Write a program to sort a list of numbers.

"Sorting" usually refers to "sorting in ascending order", unless specified otherwise.
